### CHP Research Grant Project

This work with Dr. Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider and Dr. Karle Flanagan was motivated by the realization of the lack of accessible and digestible weather visualizations for many national locations, such as Champaign, IL. Rather, weather visualizations tend to focus on major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, IL. As weather conditions continue to evolve across the world due to climate change, it is becoming increasingly important that people have easy access to both current and historical weather trends in their location of interest. The visualization updates to display the current dayâ€™s historical maximum or minimum temperature which allows the user to interact with a distinct visualization and learn more about their local weather every day. The final outcome of the visualizations allows the users to see accurate weather data in their location of interest and will allow them to draw their own conclusion or unique interpretation.

### Undergraduate Senior Thesis

This work with Dr. Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider and Dr. Karle Flanagan was inspired by the ["Weather Radials"](http://www.weather-radials.com/) visualization. The motivation was to expand on the "Weather Radials" visualization of yearly temperature patterns by allowing the user to compare historical weather trends in cities and towns across the country.
