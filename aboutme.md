I use a wide variety of geospatial datasets to help with soil sample design and soil data analsysis. Both inside and outside of my career, I am passionate about teaching statistics at an introductory level and learning new and exciting teaching methods that incorporate active learning. In addition, I enjoy creating interactive visualizations with data I find interesting!
